# A fasting app

This application is a browser extension for setting and tracking intermittent fasting goals. 
Fasts are saved locally on the browser via localStorage. 
The vanilla Javascript and initial style version of this application can be found [in this repository](https://github.com/fayponjp/fasting-window)

This project was written with:
- JS React
- Vanilla CSS
- Vite
  
There are currently 4 goal options:
- [13 hours Circadian Rhythm reset](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/nutrition/circadian-rhythm-fasting)
- [16:8 Intermittent Fast](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/16-8-intermittent-fasting)
- [18:6 Intermittent Fast](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34961821/)
- [20hour OMAD](https://www.health.com/weight-loss/omad-diet)

## Expansion Goals
